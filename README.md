# Foodheat

## Description & Background

We believe there is so much we can learn about people by looking at the kinds of foods that surround them.  As New Yorkers, we understand that much of our cultural richness is thanks to the various cultural backgrounds of its people.
We decided to build this application in an effort to provide a better, more visual representation of where the different communities are typically concentrated.

## Usage

It's simple!  Just click on a cuisine you would like to explore, and the heatmap will be rendered!
